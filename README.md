# Android NFC Example

This has a starting point for hooking up Android's NFC facilities from Fuse.

The project in [Example/Basics](./Example/Basics/) will show a simple message when an NFC device is scanned.

The [implementation](https://github.com/cbaggers/FuseAndroidNFCExample/blob/master/src/JS.uno#L64) does not handle the different events separately, but it is hoped that this is enough to get started.
